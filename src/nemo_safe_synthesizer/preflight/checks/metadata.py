    """Verify that records and groups fit within the model's context window.

    This check is a heuristic approximation of what the training assembler
    will see, not an exact simulation. Known sources of drift:

    - Sampling: only the first ``token_sample_size`` rows (default 5000)
      and the largest ``top_groups_to_check`` groups (default 100) are
      tokenized; a long-tail outlier outside the sample can still fail at
      assembly time.
    - Top-by-records bias: groups are ranked by row count, but token
      budget is driven by serialized text length -- a group with fewer rows
      but very wide columns could exceed the budget without being flagged.
    - PII-replacement drift: on ``--validate`` the data has *not* been
      PII-replaced, so token counts reflect the raw input rather than the
      replaced text the assembler actually sees. Replacement tokens can be
      shorter or longer than the originals.

    Treat the output as a strong signal, not a guarantee; a clean result
    means the sampled rows and top groups fit, not that every row will.
